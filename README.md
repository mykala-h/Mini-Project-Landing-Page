# Mini Project Landing Page - HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

Create a codebase that follows accessibility standards and is SEO optimized

## Motivation
My motivation and reason for refractoring the code was to get more comfortable with reading code and figuring out how the code could be improved upon. 

This project solves two problems: 1, it follows accessibility guidelines to give an optimal UX for everyone who visits the site; 2, making the site accessible allows the company to rank higher on SEO. Which in turn, can lead to more traffic on their website. 

During this project I learned, how to solve the issue of divergent branches; how adding sematics makes it easier to understand the structure of a webpage; how descriptive classes and ids can help a future developer decifer what is what.

## Description

Refractored starter code to increase UX by doing the following:

* Replaced div elements with semantic elemets to make the code easier to read and understand

* Organzied the page elements to follow a logical structure

* Added alt attributes to better assist those with screen readers

* All headings folllow a sequential sequence 

* Updated title page to better optimize search results
